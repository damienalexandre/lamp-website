-- INFO --

The base theme provides many resources to all subthemes including
templates, layout CSS, base CSS helper, template overrides, function
overrides and theme settings. You should not edit this theme - its only
job is to provide resources to subthemes.

-- TEMPLATES --

All the HTML5 templates are in the /templates/ directory - if you need
to modify a template for your subtheme copy and paste the template into your
subtheme and clear your sites cache.

-- GPANELS --

Gpanels are multi-column layout helpers for displaying blocks in vertical columns 
that you can drop into your subtheme. For example you may want a 4 column footer, 
or a 3 column panel above your main content. Gpanels makes this as easy as copy 
and paste. See the README in the gpanels directory for instructions.

-- THEME SETTINGS --

The base theme provides the core layout settings that provide support for 
mobile devices and standard desktop and laptop layouts. You do not need to
add these to your subtheme - it will inherit them automatically from the
base theme. There are other settings included for breadcrumb, search, comment
title, CSS classes and extra markup.

-- CSS CLASSES --

Adaptivetheme removes many standard CSS classes from the Drupals output - we do 
this to clean up the markup because most times these classes are never used. You
can add these back (and additional useful classes) using the theme settings for 
CSS classes.
